# Net-deck
this is an Arduino Sketch which allows you to generate NET architectures on the fly in order to aid Cyberpunk Red masters in improvised netrunning. 
you can tweak two parameters at the beginning, which are the numbero of floors of the architecture and the difficulty.
then pressing a button you can randomly generate the architecture and scroll the result via a potentiometer. 

to give it a more Cyberpunk feel i included a splash screen with the Arasaka logo and another at the bottom right of the display to keep the style consistent(but you can use Militech or your own if you wish so).
## components
- arduino UNO (that's what i had laying around)
- 2x10k potentiometer
- 1xbutton
- 128x64 i2c display
## consideration
in it's current state the GUI and some of the functions are described in italian.
